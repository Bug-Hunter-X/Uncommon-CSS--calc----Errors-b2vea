The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` where the 10px is intended to subtract from the width, but the calculation is actually performed on the height instead.  Another example would be incorrect operator precedence, like `calc(100px + 20% * 2)`, where the multiplication might not be performed before addition as intended.  Incorrect unit usage within the `calc()` function can also lead to problems. For example, mixing percentages and pixels without proper consideration of context.
