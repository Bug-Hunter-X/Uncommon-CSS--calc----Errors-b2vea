# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  These errors often involve unexpected behavior due to incorrect unit usage, operator precedence, or misinterpretations of how `calc()` interacts with the context (e.g., width vs. height). The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version and explanations.

**Key issues covered:**

* Incorrect operator precedence in `calc()` expressions.
* Unexpected height/width calculations with `calc()`.
* Incorrect unit handling within `calc()`.

This repository is intended to serve as an educational resource for understanding and avoiding these subtle yet potentially problematic scenarios in CSS.
